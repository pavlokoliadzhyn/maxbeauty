    <h2>1. MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE RULES</h2>
      <p>
      Beyond the refund rules outlined in our Terms of Use & Service and those mandated by law and applicable to you (if any), if you purchased directly from our website and were offered a money-back guarantee at checkout, you are eligible to receive a refund provided that: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>you contact us via email <a href="mailto:max@themaxbeauty.com">max@themaxbeauty.com</a> within 30 days after your initial purchase and before the end of your subscription period;</li>
        <li>you are able to demonstrate that you have actually used MaxBeauty for the period of at least 14 consecutive days by providing the relevant screenshots or another confirmation.</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>2. GENERAL REFUND RULES</h2>
    <p>Generally, if you do not meet the conditions set out above, the fees you have paid are non-refundable and/or non-exchangeable, unless otherwise is stated herein or is required by applicable law.</p>
    <p><strong>Note for residents of certain US states.</strong> If you reside in a state of the US, where there is an applicable law that allows so, and you cancel the purchase at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of such purchase, we will return the payment you have made.</p>
    <p><strong>Note for the EU residents.</strong> If you are an EU resident, you have the right to withdraw from the agreement for purchase of digital content without charge and without giving any reason within fourteen (14) days from the date of such agreement conclusion. The withdrawal right does not apply if the performance of the agreement has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal. You hereby expressly consent to the immediate performance of the agreement and acknowledge that you will lose your right of withdrawal from the agreement once our servers validate your purchase and the applicable purchase is successfully delivered to you. Therefore, you will not be eligible for a refund, unless the digital content is defective.</p>
