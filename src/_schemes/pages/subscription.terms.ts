It is crucial to review the payment page for the applicable subscription terms. For instance, the subscription period may be of the following duration: one month (measured as a 28-day period), three months (measured as a 84-day period) or six months (measured as a 168-day period).</p> 
  <p>All relevant and applicable fees will be clearly stated on the payment page, which we advise reading carefully. We may charge any of the fees in a single transaction or in a number of separate transactions.</p>

Such offers may include, but not limited to, introductory offers, when a you set up an account and initiate you first subscription with us.</p>
